##### Ask a clear question, [discover], provide a clear answer (report.ipynb)

- Share four questions in final report
    - >=2 supported by statistical test

- *You should call out questions of the data using natural language that speaks to the business stakeholders in markdown cells, ideally a header prior to the visualization or statistical test, that you then explore. This does not take the place of stating your null hypothesis/alternative hypothesis when doing a statistical test. But those hypotheses are generally for you. By writing questions that you intend to answer with visualizations and statistical tests in natural language, like ""Are office supplies leading to differences in profit in Texas?"", you are able to guide both yourself and your reader through the highlights of your analysis. You ask a question, create a visual, run a statistical test (if appropriate), and wrap it nicely with a markdown cell that contains a clear answer in layman's terms. You do all that before moving to the next question.*

##### Exploring through visualizations (report.ipynb)

- *At least 5 visualations are included in your final report.*

- *The ones included answer a question (remember, NO is an answer) or provide necessary context (such as the distribution of the target variable). All statistical tests included in the final report should be supported with an visualization of the interaction of the variables being tested. Charts in the final report should have titles and labels that are descriptive and useful for the end user/audience/consumer of the report.*

- *All visualizations in the final report are mentioned or discussed if a verbal presentation is given.*

##### Statistical tests (report.ipynb)

- *At least 2 statistical tests are included in your final report.*

- *The correct tests are run, given the data type and distribution, and the correct conclusions are drawn. For example (other tests may be used):*

  - *correlation: 2 continuous variables, normally distributed, testing for LINEAR correlation only (H_0: Not linearly dependent)*

  - *independent t-test: 1 continuous, somewhat normally distributed variable, one boolean variable, equal variance, independent (H_0: population mean of each group is equal)*
  
  - *chi-square test: 2 discrete variables. (H_0: the 2 variables are independent of each other).*

##### Summary (report.ipynb)

- *Following your exploration section, you summarize your analysis (in a **markdown** cell using natural language): what you found and how you will use it moving forward.*


##### Select Evaluation Metric (Report.ipynb)

- *Will use accuracy and recall.*


##### Evaluate Baseline (Report.ipynb)

- *Baseline predicts everyone will remain. 73% accurate*

##### Develop 3 Models (Report.ipynb)

- *Made 4 models: decision tree, random forrest, knn, and logistic regression*

#### Evaluate on Train (Report.ipynb)

##### Evaluate on Validate (Report.ipynb)

#### Evaluate Top Model on Test (Report.ipynb)
